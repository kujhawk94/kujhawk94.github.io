In what has become a Brull family tradition, we celebrated the Fourth of July with morning canoeing in Big Creek, a picnic supper, patriotic music and fireworks after dark.

The [2016 edition of this family tradition photo album][1] is ready to view.  For "historical" perspective, previous years' albums are also available:  [2015][2], [2014][3], [2013][4], [2012][5], [2011][6], [2010][7], [2009][8].  The kids sure have grown up a lot since 2009!
