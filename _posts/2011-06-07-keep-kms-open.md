To the USD489 Board of Education:

I would like to add my voice to those who are asking you to reconsider your decision to close Kennedy Middle School.

Two thoughts crossed my mind while watching last night's hearing.

First - I noticed no one stood to speak in favor of closing Kennedy Middle School.  As the representatives of the people of the district, I would find this a significant statement of the "will of the people."  No one spoke in favor of a middle school with over 700 students.  No one spoke in favor of educating students in FEMA trailers.  No spoke in favor of increasing class sizes and cutting staff.  I understand that the supporters of KMS would be much more motivated to attend the hearing, but to have no one speaking in favor of the closing seems a powerful statement that maybe this is not the right time for this decision.

Second - contrary to statements asserting that school size does not matter, there is no doubt that school size does affect our children's opportunities to participate in school activities.  One school instead of two means one starting quarterback instead of two.  One school instead of two means one STUCO president instead of two.  One school instead of two means one quiz bowl team instead of two.

One school instead of two means no choice instead of one important choice for our children's education.

Please don't make a permanent decision to solve a temporary problem.
