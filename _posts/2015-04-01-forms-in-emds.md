People using Word 2013 need to adjust a setting so they can produce forms with the "blue form" icon in e-MDs.

## Open Microsoft Word 2013

By default Word 2013 opens with a screen asking what kind of document you want to create.  Choose a "Blank document" to access a "regular" Word document view.

## Make sure the "Open e-mail attachments..." option is unchecked

Make sure the "Open e-mail attachements and other uneditable files in reading view" option is **UNCHECKED** and then click on "OK".

Then you can close and quit Word 2013.  Forms from e-MDs should open properly now.
