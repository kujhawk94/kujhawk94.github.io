Our family’s summer vacation this year was a four-night stay on Coronado Island near San Diego, California.  

[Trip photos][8]

Trip highlights included the following:

* [Silver Strand State Beach][1]
* [SeaWorld][2]
* [Bankers Hill Restaurant][3]
* [Sondheim’s Into the Woods][4] at the [Old Globe Theatre][5]
* Walk across the [Cabrillo Bridge][6]
* [Loews Coronado Bay][7] resort

And despite [Frontier’s][9] best efforts to derail our return on Friday, we did finally arrive at our own beds and are slowly re-adjusting to central daylight time and the lack of a nearby beach.
