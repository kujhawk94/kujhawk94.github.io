title: "Entertaining (obnoxious) password requirements"
date: 2012-04-18

So I've been looking at this list every 60 days now for the better of
a year.  And every time I need to tweak <a
href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a> so that it will
generate a compliant password (exactly 8 characters long – really?).
And as obnoxious as the requirements are, it turns out that they have
actually omitted one rule that is enforced upon changing your
password, namely that the password <em>must begin with a letter of the
alphabet</em>.

I suspect folks involved with health care will recognize the requirements.

The list forbidden passwords is also entertaining.  They include many of the
<a href="http://techland.time.com/2011/11/22/the-25-most-popular-and-worst-
passwords-of-2011/">25 Most Popular (and Worst) Passwords</a> as reported by
Time magazine, but not all.  Many of the words on the explicitly banned list
would be excluded by enforcement of the 8 character requirement.  Nor is the
list ordered in any way to make it easy to see if your choice is actually in
the list.

Sigh.
