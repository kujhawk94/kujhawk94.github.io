Same old material moved to [jekyll][1] static site generator.

Time to reminisce with the wayback machine (sadly, not all of the images are archived):

* [1995][3]: I've been doing the post a form, query the data, return a file for a long time now.
* [1997][2]: As I recall this included a fabulous background image.  Also, I have looked more than once through various backup folders for the "Snokomo chasing his tail" movie.  That two second clip took up an enormous amout of disk space at the time.
* [1997][4]: The spiffy personal information page I constructed while working at KUMC.

Kind of sad there aren't more...time to rummage through some old backup cd's lying around the house.
