Found a [nice article][1] on [serverfault.com][2] describing how to easily remove a single rule iptables while it is running.

> Use the `--line-numbers` option to iptables to get a listing which shows the line numbers for the rules in a chain e.g.

> ```
> iptables -L fail2ban-SSH -v -n --line-numbers
> Chain fail2ban-SSH (1 references)
> num   pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out   source              destination
> 1       19  2332 DROP       all  --  *      *     193.87.172.171      0.0.0.0/0
> 2       16  1704 DROP       all  --  *      *     222.58.151.68       0.0.0.0/0
> 3       15   980 DROP       all  --  *      *     218.108.224.81      0.0.0.0/0

> 5     8504  581K RETURN     all  --  *      *     0.0.0.0/0           0.0.0.0/0
