The soote season, that bud and blome furth bringes,  
With grene had clad the hill and eke the vale;  
The nightingale with fethers new she singes;  
The turtle to her make had tolde her tale.  
Somer is come, for every spray nowe springes;  
The hart hath hong his olde hed on the pale;  
The buck in brake his winder cote he flings;  
The fishes flote with newe repaired scale;  
The adder all her sloughe awaye she slinges;  
The swift swalow pursueth the flyes smale;  
The busy bee her honye now she minges;  
Winter is worne that was the flowers bale.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus I see among these pleasant thinges  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Eache care decayes, and yet my sorow springes.
