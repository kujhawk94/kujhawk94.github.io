It had been a rough day, so when I walked into the party I was very
chalant, despite my efforts to appear gruntled and consolate.

I was furling my weildy umbrella for the coat check when I saw her
standing alone in a corner. She was a descript person, a woman in a
state of total array. Her hair was kempt, her clothing shevelled, and
she moved in a gainly way.

I wanted desperately to meet her, but I knew I’d have to make bones
about it, since I was travelling cognito. Beknowst to me, the hostess,
whom I could see both hide and hair of, was very proper, so it would
be skin off my nose if anything bad happened. And even though I had
only swerving loyalty to her, my manners couldn’t be peccable. Only
toward and heard-of behavior would do.

Fortunately, the embarrassment that my maculate appearance might cause
was evitable. There were two ways about it, but the chances that
someone as flappable as I would be ept enough to become persona grata
or a sung hero were slim. I was, after all, something to sneeze at,
someone you could easily hold a candle to, someone who usually aroused
bridled passion.

So I decided not to risk it. But then, all at once, for some apparent
reason, she looked in my direction and smiled in a way that I could
make head or tails of.

I was plussed. It was concerting to see that she was communicado, and
it nerved me that she was interested in a pareil like me, sight seen.
Normally, I had a domitable spirit, but, being corrigible, I felt
capacitated—as if this were something I was great shakes at—and forgot
that I had succeeded in situations like this only a told number of
times. So, after a terminable delay, I acted with mitigated gall and
made my way through the ruly crowd with strong givings.

Nevertheless, since this was all new hat to me and I had not time to
prepare a promptu speech, I was petuous. Wanting to make only called-
for remarks, I started talking about the hors d’oeuvres, trying to
abuse her of the notion that I was sipid, and perhaps even bunk a few
myths about myselfs.

She responded well, and I was mayed that she considered me a savoury
character who was up to some good. She told me who she was. “What a
perfect nomer,” I said, advertently. The conversation became more and
more choate, and we spoke at length to much avail. But I was
defatigable, so I had to leave at a godly hour. I asked if she wanted
to come with me. To my delight, she was committal. We left the party
together and have been together ever since. I have given her my love,
and she has requited it.
