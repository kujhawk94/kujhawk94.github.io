Here's an interesting term I ran across today: Â <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving">yak shaving</a>.
<blockquote><em>(idiomatic) Any apparently useless activity which, by allowing you to overcome intermediate difficulties, allows you to solve a larger problem.</em></blockquote>
I also like the phrase that appers in the <em>See also </em>section, "when you're up to your neck in alligators, it's easy to forget that the initial objective was to drain the swamp."
